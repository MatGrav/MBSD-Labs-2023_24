# MBSD-Assignment

This repository contains our take on the laboratories for the course "Model-based software design" at Politecnico di Torino during the academic year 2023/24.

This year's topic is the life cycle of a "One-Pedal controller".

The group is made of:
- Matteo Gravagnone s319634
- Danilo Guglielmi  s318083

The work has been developed in group through, mostly with a pair-coding approach (so the number of commits of each person is not a sufficient metric to represent everyone's effort).
